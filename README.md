# Fraction in TypeScript

## FYI

While I was reading the book *Software Craft* (ISBN 978-2-10-082520-2), I first try to do with my knowledge of TDD the
exercise show at the end of part 1 of this book.

This repo is my realisation of the exercise before reading their solution.

I stop near to the end, but this can be improved with some refactoring (I can see quite a duplication in operation, need
to think on how I could simplify this using the four rules of simple design), one more business rules using Euclidean
division for better result to be accurate with their AC and edge case like division by zero.

## run this

```
npm run test
```
